# Contributing

🚫 This repository is currently **closed for external contributions**.  
It is maintained solely as a **personal observability lab and project showcase**.

## Why Closed?

- This is part of my DevOps learning journey  
- All experiments, notes, and screenshots are personal work  
- Prevents misuse or blind copy-pasting of configs/screenshots  

## Future Contributions

✅ Contribution guidelines may be opened **after 1–2 months**, once projects are stable.  
When that happens, specific instructions will be added here.

- ⭐ **Star this repository** if you find it interesting  
- 👀 **Watch** for updates to follow along  
- 💬 Share respectful feedback via LinkedIn or email
