# 🔍 Observability Lab — Hands-On Monitoring & Projects

> **Personal hands-on repository for monitoring and observability tools**

Welcome to the **Observability Lab** — my dedicated space for experimenting with and building projects around **Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, and related tools**.  

This repository is **not open for contributions at this time**. It is maintained solely for **personal learning, hands-on experiments, and portfolio projects**.  
In the future, contribution guidelines may be opened selectively.

## 🎯 Purpose

- ✅ Hands-on labs and exercises with observability tools  
- ✅ Small-to-medium projects combining multiple tools  
- ✅ A personal record of monitoring/observability journey  

---

## 📌 Important Notice

- ❌ **No Contributions Right Now**: PRs and issues will not be accepted until further notice.  
- ❌ **No Blind Copy-Paste**: All screenshots, configs, and notes are created by me for my own learning.  
- ✅ **Learning Resource**: Feel free to star ⭐ and watch 👀 this repo if you want to follow updates.
